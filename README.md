# world-earthquakes

Introduction:

In this project, I have analysed earthquake data to explore trends and understand patterns of seismic activity around the world.

The real challenge for this project was data inconsistancies and limitations. 

Artifacts:

PallaviDalvi_World_Earthquakes_ProcessDocumentation.docx gives detailed explaination about data limitations, tableau workbook structure as well as outlines the findings and recommendation as part of analysis.

PallaviDalvi_EarthquakeAnalysis.twbx is tableau workbook consisting all visualisation and story.
